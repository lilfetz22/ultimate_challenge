# ultimate_challenge

This repository takes an example dataset about the fictional Ultimate company. In this project there are 3 parts: Exploratory Data 
Analysis, Experimental metrics and design, and predictive modeling. I utilized all of the experience I have gained from my 6 months of
my springboard course in order to create a hands-on example project that potentially could be answers to questions I may have to answer
as a data scientist.
